Express-JS useful concepts
----

The Express Class
--
* There is an express class that basically creates an instance of an express
application and exposes all the application functionality through an instance
of this class.
* An instance of the express application exposes get(), post() and other
  methods analogous of HTTP request methods used to service HTTP requests to
  the application.
* These methods take a Route Path string and callback functions as arguments.
* The Route Path can include regular expressions and has special characters
  reserved as regex tokens.
* The callback functions can be a single function, multiple functions seperated
  by commas and a list of functions.
* in order to call the next function in the list or line of functions given as
  arguments to one of these express class methods, the next() method must be
  called in the calling function.
* Together these functions can be thought to form a chain of callback functions
  each of which uses the next method to call the next function in the
  line/list.

The Express Router Class
---
* express.router is class that basically functions as a mini express
  application.

The Express Pipline
---
* The entire express application is basically a pipeline of ordered functions and a
  server.
* The server listens for requests to specific urls and then jumps to the 
  appropriate point in the pipline.
* The pipline of functions consitis of middlewears and routes. The order in
  which these are specified dictates the way in which a request is handled.
* A route is the point to which the application control jumps to after running
  the initial portion of the pipeline before every request. Once the control
  flow jumps to the specified route, the applications executes the pipline in
  order until it reaches a request termination of some sort.
