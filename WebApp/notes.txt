React uselful concepts.
--
* The simplest react component is a function that returns a jsx element.
* The props object in each react component is a single object that refers to the
properties and children for that react component.

State
-
* State can only be used in React class based components.
* The state is assigned is initialized with a json object in the constructor
  and is the only time that it is assigned a value using the '=' sign. All
  subsequent changes to state are made by passing a new object representing
  the new state to the this.setState(newStateObject) method. Calling this
  method re-renders the component automatically.
* State updates may be asynchronous and React may batch multiple setState() calls into a single update for performance.
* State can be used to trickle data down to child components thrugh props. But
  this flow can only go downwards.
